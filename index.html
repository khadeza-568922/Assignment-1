        <h5>Innovation</h5>
        <p>
            Bangladesh has made progress in innovation in the areas of technology, startups, and digital services. These innovations have helped the country create jobs, improve productivity, and reduce unemployment.  </p>

        <h5>Sustainability</h5>
        <p>Bangladesh has taken many steps to promote sustainable development, including investing in human-centered democracy, and creating policies to balance economic, social, and environmental needs.

        <h5>Infrastructure</h5>
        
      
        <p> The overall conclusion is that infrastructure plays a critical role in encouraging Bangladesh's progress. The design of a district-by-district Infrastructure Development Index (IDI) and the ranking of districts on the IDI imply that districts near the capital city have higher IDIs than districts further away.  </p>

            <p>To bring law and order to the country. We were trying to work it out through the police, which is normal. But the police have lost their moral courage because when they face people, they hear bitter words. Just a few days ago they killed some students, so they are distancing themselves — they don’t want to be out front. So, as they lost morale, we lost the strength of law and order. But as we’ve said before, not everyone in the police is responsible for wrongdoing. We will identify those who have done wrong. They will be brought to justice. But this is a long process; it’s not happening all of a sudden. And in the meantime, law and order is being violated — different types of violations are happening. We thought that if we allowed this to continue, then conditions would deteriorate, so the issue of giving powers to our army came up. We asked the army, and they agreed. They said, “We're here, but no one is heeding us because we do not have any power. If we had some power, the people would be cautious.” We then gave them the magistracy power but for a limited period, for two months. That’s how it happened.
